<h1>Analyser and Static Spotter</h1>

<b>Process type:</b> tool-driven <br>
<b>Roles:</b> System Architect <br>
<b>Input:</b> Requirements Specification, ScaleDL Usage Evolution instance <br>
<b>Output:</b> Analyser and Static Spotter Output <br>
<b>Description:</b> Analyser and Static Spotter process analyses a modelled system (ScaleDL Usage Evo-
lution instance) to check whether it meets the scalability requirements of the requirement spec-
ification. The Analyser is a tool that can automatically execute these checks and Static Spotter
can detect scalability issues on model level. <br>
To do so, outputs of this process are scalability predictions for the modelled system. Based on
this first output, Analyser can further output whether a requirement is met or not, respectively.
In case it is not met, additional analyses can automatically be executed by Static Spotter to
detect the causes for that (e.g., Static Spotter identifies a guilty component).
Example: The architect who modeled the TPC-W system via a ScaleDL Usage Evolution instance
executes the Analyser on this instance. The elasticity requirement specified in the requirement
specification is checked (the system should be capable of responding in less than 3 seconds
for user arrival rates between 1 and 60 users per hour). The Analyser then predicts whether
the requirement is met or not. <br>
<b>Status:</b> Analyser is currently in a conceptual phase. It will be based on Palladio and SimuLizar. The
first prototype allowing to analyse a simple example will be available at M12. Static Spotter is
also currently in a conceptual phase.
