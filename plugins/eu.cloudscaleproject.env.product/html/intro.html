				<h1>CloudScale Environment</h1>
				<p>CloudScale Environment provides scalability analysis of the cloud based systems. It consists of 
				three separate tools (Analyser, Extractor and Spotter), seamlessly integrated in the environment, 
				each providing specific functionalities, covering most important steps in the development of the
				cloud based solutions: architecting new cloud-based systems, migration of legacy systems 
				into the cloud and optimization of existing cloud systems.

				<h1>Analyser</h1>
				<p>Analyser is a software architecture simulation framework, which analyses
software at the model level for performance bottlenecks, scalability
issues and reliability threats, and allows for a subsequent
optimisation. In the CloudScale Environment mainly the backend engines
will be used to analyse the user’s application. This will be achieved by
automatically transforming CloudScale Models into the Palladio Component
Models; structure on which Palladio operates.

				<h1>Extractor</h1>
				<p>Extractor combines clustering-based architecture reconstruction and
pattern detection techniques to recover the architecture of a software
system from source code. While the clustering extracts a software
architecture based on source code metrics, the pattern detection is used
to detect design deficiencies in the architecture, which influence the
architecture reconstruction negatively.

				<h1>Static Spotter</h1>
				<p>Static Spotter is a tool for identifying (“spotting”) scalability problems in
Cloud applications. The tool consists of two main components that are
provided as two separate programs: Static and Dynamic spotters. The
Static Spotter analyses the application code to find scalability
anti-patterns. The Dynamic Spotter analyse the execution of the
application (through systematic measurements) to find scalability
anti-patterns in the application’s behaviour.
