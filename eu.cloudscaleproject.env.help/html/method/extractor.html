<h1>Extractor</h1>
<b>Process type:</b> tool-driven <br>
<b>Roles:</b> System Architect <br>
<b>Input:</b> Existing System, ScaleDL instance <br>
<b>Output:</b> Extractor Output <br>
<b>Description:</b> Extractor extracts software architecture from source codes and visualizes with PCM
model. During extraction Extractor finds CloudScale Architectural Templates in software ar-
chitecture automatically. Extractor extends Tool Archimetrix, enhances its functionalities and
provides support for cloud computing environment. <br>
<b>Example:</b> The architect who wants to model TPC-W uses Extractor to generate software architec-
ture model automatically. He simply runs Extractor serving TPC-W code base. <br>
<b>Status:</b> Extractor is under development. It is based on Archimetrix. It enhances Archimetrix func-
tionalities, e.g. it could generate PCM model, and extends its support for cloud computing
environment. <br>
