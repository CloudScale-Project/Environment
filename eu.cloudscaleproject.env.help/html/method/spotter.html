<h1>Dynamic Spotter</h1>
<b>Process type:</b> tool-driven <br>
<b>Roles:</b> System Architect <br>
<b>Input:</b> System Model or Analyser Output, ScaleDL Usage Evolution instance <br>
<b>Output:</b> Dynamic Spotter Output <br>
<b>Description:</b> Dynamic Spotter is a tool which finds components which are responsible for hindering
performance by inspecting software architecture and codes. If these responsible components
fit certain anti-patterns, Dynamic Spotter also suggests solutions automatically. Dynamic Spotter
uses System Model or Analyser Output as an input with proper system operational parameters
and works with running system. <br>
<b>Example:</b> After Analyser and Static Spotter find that System Model does not fulfil Requirements, the
architect runs Dynamic Spotter to locate "bad" components. Dynamic Spotter inspects System
Model and codes. When Dynamic Spotter finds anti-patterns in the existing system, it also
suggests solutions to alter the flawed software architecture or codes. The architect chooses
one of the suggested solutions and Dynamic Spotter applies the change automatically.
Status: Dynamic Spotter is currently in a conceptual phase. <br>
